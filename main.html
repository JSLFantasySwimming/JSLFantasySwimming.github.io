      <h2>About Fantasy Swimming</h2>
      <p>Fantasy swimming is exactly what it sounds like. Similar to fantasy football, players draft teams who then compete against each other throughout a season. In our case, the teams are swimmers and the season is JSL. Every Wednesday, team members will score points at their dual meets which will tally up into the main scores. Whoever wins at the end wins. Fantasy swimming was designed almost entirely by Teddy Cross and Walker Davis over the span of 5 - 10 minutes after practice one day.</p>
